# A/B Testing

# Data Cleaning and Analysis
Before conducting the A/B test, the data was cleaned and analyzed to ensure it was ready for testing. The following steps were taken:

- Checked for missing data: There were no missing values in the dataset.
- Checked for outliers: Outliers were removed based on the interquartile range (IQR) method.
Conducted a hypothesis test: A hypothesis test was conducted to determine whether there was a significant difference in purchase amounts between the two variations of the "Shop Now" button.

# A/B Testing
The A/B test was conducted using a two-sample t-test to compare the purchase amounts for Variation A and Variation B. The following steps were taken:

- Formulated null and alternative hypotheses: The null hypothesis was that there was no significant difference in purchase amounts between Variation A and Variation B. The alternative hypothesis was that there was a significant difference.
- Calculated the test statistic and p-value: The test statistic was calculated using the two-sample t-test formula. The p-value was calculated using the t-distribution.
- Determined statistical significance: The p-value was compared to the significance level (alpha) to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not.

# Results
Based on the A/B test, the p-value was found to be less than the significance level of 0.05, indicating that there was a significant difference in purchase amounts between Variation A and Variation B. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
