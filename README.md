# A/B Testing

# Data Cleaning and Analysis
Before conducting the A/B test, the data was cleaned and analyzed to ensure it was ready for testing. The following steps were taken:

- Checked for missing data: There were no missing values in the dataset.
- Checked for outliers: Outliers were removed based on the interquartile range (IQR) method.
Conducted a hypothesis test: A hypothesis test was conducted to determine whether there was a significant difference in purchase amounts between the two variations of the "Shop Now" button.

# A/B Testing
The A/B test was conducted using a two-sample t-test to compare the purchase amounts for Variation A and Variation B. The following steps were taken:

- Formulated null and alternative hypotheses: The null hypothesis was that there was no significant difference in purchase amounts between Variation A and Variation B. The alternative hypothesis was that there was a significant difference.
- Calculated the test statistic and p-value: The test statistic was calculated using the two-sample t-test formula. The p-value was calculated using the t-distribution.
- Determined statistical significance: The p-value was compared to the significance level (alpha) to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not.

# Results
After analyzing the data, we found that the p-value was 0.14, which is greater than our significance level. Therefore, we did not reject the null hypothesis, and we concluded that changing the color of the 'Shop Now' button did not have a statistically significant impact on the click-through rate..
